The dashboard empowered stakeholders to identify high-performing regions, understand customer preferences, and optimize pricing strategies to enhance business operations and customer satisfaction.


### Tableau
- **[Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages Analysis](https://github.com/ShivakrishnaMacha/Tableau-Project/tree/main)**: Conducted an in-depth analysis of employment and wage data from various industries and regions, based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages dataset from the New York State Government's open data portal. The visualization aims to offer valuable insights into industry dynamics, labor market trends, and regional economic performance.

### SQL
- **[Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis using Sql](https://github.com/ShivakrishnaMacha/Netflix_Sql_Project)**: Extracted valuable insights from Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. Addressed various business questions and delivered actionable findings to inform strategic decisions.

- **[Amazon USA Sales Analysis](https://github.com/ShivakrishnaMacha/Amazon-USA-Sales-Analysis)**: Analyzed over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform using PostgreSQL. Tackled complex SQL challenges, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management, to deliver actionable insights into customer behavior and product performance.

-  **[Zomato Data Analysis](https://github.com/ShivakrishnaMacha/Zomato_SQL_Data_Analysis/tree/main)**: Analyzed Zomato's data to showcase my SQL problem-solving skills. This project involved designing and setting up the database, importing and cleaning the data, managing null values, and resolving real-world business challenges by writing and executing complex SQL queries.

### Machine Learning/Deep Learning
- **[Heart Failure Prediction](https://github.com/ShivakrishnaMacha/Heart_Failure_Prediction)**:  Built a machine learning pipeline to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using data from the Framingham Heart Study. Conducted exploratory data analysis, feature engineering (including pulse pressure and log transformations), and handled class imbalance with SMOTE. Evaluated multiple models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Achieved a recall score of 0.98 with a tuned XGBoost model, making it effective for early CHD risk screening. Deployed the model using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

- **[Student Performance Prediction](https://github.com/ShivakrishnaMacha/Student_Performance_Prediction)**: Built a machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict student scores using the Students Performance Dataset. Performed EDA, feature engineering, and categorical encoding. Tested models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and CatBoost, with CatBoost achieving the best R² score above 0.90.
